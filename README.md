# Online Gaming Website

This project is a **frontend demo of an online gaming website** developed as a **group mini project** for a **Web Development course** using **HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript**.  
The main objective of this mini project is to practice and demonstrate core web development concepts such as layout design, responsive UI, styling, and basic client-side interaction while working collaboratively in a team environment.

The website features a **modern and visually engaging interface**, including a **login/sign-up page**, a **game showcase section** with multiple game cards, star ratings, and external game links. A **background video** is used to enhance the overall gaming experience and make the UI more dynamic and immersive.

The project is completely **static** and does not include any backend or database functionality. Form validation is handled using **basic JavaScript**, and navigation is implemented using standard HTML elements.

This project is ideal for:
- Students completing a **Web Development mini project**
- Beginners learning **HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript**
- College students working on **group projects**
- Developers building a **frontend portfolio**
