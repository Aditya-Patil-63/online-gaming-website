# Online Gaming Website

This project is a **frontend demo of an online gaming website** developed using **HTML and CSS**.  
The main goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate core web development skills such as layout design, responsive UI, styling, and basic client-side interaction.

The website features a **modern and visually engaging interface**, including a **login/sign-up page**, a **game showcase section** with multiple game cards, star ratings, and external game links. A **background video** is used to enhance the overall gaming experience and make the UI more dynamic and immersive.

The project is completely **static** and does not include any backend or database functionality. Form validation is handled using **basic JavaScript**, and navigation is implemented using standard HTML elements.

This project is ideal for:
- Beginners learning **HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript**
- Students working on **college or practice projects**
- Developers building a **frontend portfolio**
- Anyone exploring **UI design for gaming websites**
